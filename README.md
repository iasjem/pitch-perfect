# Pitch Perfect App

* This project is based on a [Udacity course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud585) as part of my journey in learning how to code in Swift.
* The lesson covers various topics including making use of the AVFoundation library and autolayouts.
* I do not own any of the assets for this app and only serves as self-study.
